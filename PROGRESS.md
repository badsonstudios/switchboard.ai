# PROGRESS — switchboard.ai

> Live state. Updated the moment an item starts, finishes, or hits a blocker.
> A fresh session reads this file and knows exactly where things stand.

**Milestone:** Phase 2 - The Switchboard (E7+E8+E10 merged; E12 merged;
E9/E11/E13/E14 still outlines)
**In progress:** nothing mid-flight. Rounds 4+5 **MERGED to main (PR #67,
baecd48)**: phantom-beep fix (allow-all answered in main — was review P2
#19), starting-state Terminal chip, self-healing tail-pin, working-banner
restyle, Events uniform height + dismiss ✕, rail task labels,
duplicate-title -N suffix, composer stop button. Review P1 (#6–#17)
merged earlier (PR #66).
**Next up:** **P2-E10-07 composer slash commands (full support)** — PROMOTED
to the next work item (owner 2026-07-24; plan updated, issue filed on
pickup; includes /clear as the first session control). [user] retests on
merged main (rebuild first): test 4 (out-of-cwd read) WITHOUT allow-all +
autonomy=ask · grid-drag between groups · switch-to-session scroll ·
allow-all sessions now silent.
**Branch:** main

## Testing (3 layers — see skills/startup/references/testing.md)
`npm test` (unit) · `npm run check:*` (local real-claude proofs) · `npm run e2e`
(Playwright drives the real window headlessly; fake provider = shell-in-a-PTY,
temp-home isolated, CI-safe). **New user-facing surface ⇒ add an e2e test, not
a "[Dan eyeball]" note.**

## Phase status

- **Spike 01 — DONE** (all mechanisms GO; merged).
- **Phase 1 — MVP — DONE & MERGED** (PR #36 → main, 2026-07-20): full app —
  session core, hooks, transcripts, git, notifications, persistence +
  resume-on-focus, auto-trust. CI green 3 OSes. Milestone closed.
- **Phase 2 — The Switchboard — E7 + E8 MERGED to main** (PR #42 squash-merged
  2026-07-21, CI green 5 jobs; issues #37–#47 closed). Plan:
  `docs/plans/04-phase-2-switchboard.md` (reconciled vs DESIGN.md §8
  2026-07-21 — see log). P2-E8-06 (reconnect offer) added later, not yet
  filed. E9–E14 remain as OUTLINES — not yet expanded into work items or
  filed as issues (just-in-time; needs `/pm plan`).

## Blockers / open questions for Dan

- ~~"Red build blocks merge" (#13)~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-23**: repo is public
  → ruleset "main: green CI required to merge" (id 19646817) is ACTIVE on
  the default branch — all 5 CI checks required, force-pushes and branch
  deletion blocked. Repository-admin bypass is ON (required: direct
  PROGRESS.md/docs pushes to main can never have pre-push checks — GitHub
  rejected exactly that within minutes of the first version). The normal
  merge path still refuses a red PR; bypassing is an explicit act.
- **Loose ends deferred** (not blocking): full-auto → bypass footgun (offer:
  remap to a safer mode), 9MB Monaco renderer bundle (slim it). Say the word.
- **[user] ClaudeMon architecture read (OQ #8) is due.** `03-later-phases.md`
  says it must happen before Phase 3 planning, "ideally far earlier" — and the
  2026-07-21 reconciliation just moved MORE into Phase 3. Schedule a session
  to review ClaudeMon and decide shared-library vs sidecar vs merge.

## Log

- 2026-07-24 — **Round 5 (on PR #67): tail-pin made SELF-HEALING.** Dan:
  switching to an already-open session after app start landed at the TOP.
  Root cause: the pin was a one-shot rAF keyed on [blocks, visible] — if it
  fired before the panel had real layout (dockview shows background panels
  a frame later; restore relayouts), scrollTop wrote against scrollHeight=0
  and nothing ever retried. Now a ResizeObserver on the scroller + content
  re-pins on any size change while tail-pinned, and programmatic pins no
  longer count as user scrolls (autoPin guard — a layout-induced scroll
  event could permanently unpin). Also **P2-E10-07 slash commands PROMOTED
  to the next work item** (owner: support ALL Claude slash commands;
  /clear first — "no way to clear a conversation"); plan rewritten with
  the two halves (autocomplete + session controls) and the /clear-vs-Feed
  decision spelled out.

- 2026-07-23 — **Dan's round 4 (live testing on merged main).** Root-caused
  from the app log: the "random Windows alert noises" were review P2 #19 in
  the wild — every gated call in an allow-all session still HELD in main
  (needs-permission event → beep) before the renderer auto-allowed it 1–2ms
  later (log shows held→decided in 1ms, humanly impossible). FIX: allow-all
  moves to the MAIN process (HookListener.setAllowAll, keyed by live id,
  dies with the session; sessions:allowAllSession IPC) — a granted session's
  gated calls are answered server-side: no hold, no event, no beep. 2 unit
  tests. Also: (a) resume-from-summary picker (claude 2.1.x, on --resume of
  a 100k+ conversation) is a startup TUI dialog hooks can't see — a card
  stuck in 'starting' >8s now shows the "continue in Terminal ↗" chip;
  DESIGN §5.10 records the hazard (composer Enter blindly confirmed the
  picker; muting the composer pre-SessionStart is the candidate v2). (b)
  Working banner: label left-aligned, pulse dots right of it, ellipsis
  dropped. (c) Events: every item same height (label row always renders),
  per-item dismiss ✕ (events:dismiss → feed.forget). (d) Rail rows show the
  task label under the title. (e) New same-folder sessions auto-suffix
  their title with the first free -N (renames untouched). (f) Composer stop
  button while working — writes Esc to the PTY (the CLI's own interrupt);
  DESIGN §5.10 notes it. (g) E14 plan: events carry inline
  Allow/Allow-all/Deny (owner request, plumbing sketched). Test 4's
  "out-of-cwd read didn't prompt": log shows NO Read hold ever fired —
  the reads rode shell tools inside allow-all sessions; retest post-fix.
  Gate: lint + typecheck + 166 unit + 30 e2e green; check:hooks re-PASS.

- 2026-07-23 — **PR #66 MERGED to main (ec40c0b)** — review P1 follow-up,
  all 5 CI jobs green (one cross-platform test fix en route: the read-tool
  policy test used 'C:/...' literals, which are RELATIVE on POSIX — the
  fixed isOutsideCwd correctly called them inside; per-platform paths now).
  Also NEW: ruleset "main: green CI required to merge" ACTIVE (repo public
  → rulesets free) — all 5 checks required server-side, force-push +
  deletion blocked. #13's manual merge gate is now enforced by GitHub.

- 2026-07-23 — **Review P1 follow-up COMPLETE (#6–#17)** on
  `fix/review-p1-followup`. Watcher trio: (#6) once hooks deliver the native
  id, ONLY id evidence binds (unparseable-head files can't be cwd-claimed);
  (#7) mis-bind corrections push `sessions:feedReset` so the renderer drops
  stolen blocks; (#8) ambiguous same-cwd sessions bind best-effort after 30s
  without a native id (fail-open when hooks are dead) — claim() now also
  refuses files another session owns. (#9) tool taxonomy extracted to
  `src/shared/tool-taxonomy.ts`; watcher stamps `tool.category`; the renderer
  dispatches shell rendering on category — PowerShell gets the rich Bash
  layout. (#10) isOutsideCwd: relative paths resolve against the session
  folder; containment via path.relative (drive-root + cross-drive fixed).
  (#11) SessionStart(source:'compact') no longer flips a working session to
  idle. (#12) composer ignores Enter mid-IME-composition. (#13)
  setNotificationPrefs is a merge-patch (enabled-toggle no longer wipes
  osToasts/quiet hours). (#14) upsertBlock inserts by seq (evicted re-emits
  can't render as newest). (#15) EventsPanel: push beats in-flight list().
  (#16) relaunch-test leak pattern fixed in FIVE e2e specs. (#17) fixture
  launch failure scrubs copied credentials + temp home. P3 #31 folded into
  #6. Gate: lint + typecheck + 164 unit + 30 e2e green; check:hooks +
  check:transcripts re-PASS vs real claude 2.1.218.

- 2026-07-23 — **PR #65 MERGED to main** (Dan's call: merge now, finish the
  review P1 as a follow-up PR). The Actions-billing blocker self-resolved:
  Dan made the repo public → all 5 CI jobs re-ran GREEN (unit ×3 OS + e2e
  Win/Linux). Squash-merged as 4d179e5, branch deleted. Review work
  continues on `fix/review-p1-followup`: P1 #6–#15 + P1-test #16–#17.

- 2026-07-23 — **Upstream bug FILED** (Dan's go-ahead):
  anthropics/claude-code#80683 — interactive mode never writes the
  conversation .jsonl under a redirected HOME/USERPROFILE (full isolation
  matrix in the report). **Review P0 cluster FIXED** (docs/code-review-
  2026-07-23-phase-2-e10.md, all 5): (#1, owner picked Option A) plan
  sessions NEVER hold — an in-app allow would bypass the CLI's plan
  write-block; DESIGN §5.16 records the rule; (#2) allow-all keyed by LIVE
  session id — respawns prompt again; (#3) pending holds replay to a
  (re)mounting renderer via sessions:pendingPermissions — a missed push
  can't park the CLI; (#4) held requests QUEUE per card ("+N more
  waiting", advance on decide); (#5) a hold auto-surfaces the Session tab
  from any tab. e2e: Terminal-tab hold → auto-surface → two-deep queue →
  allow+deny verdicts. 151 unit + 30 e2e green; real-claude lane green.
  P1 (#6–#15) next.

- 2026-07-23 — **Transcript-in-sandbox anomaly SOLVED (root cause
  characterized; upstream CLI bug).** Dan asked for online research +
  systematic isolation. Web findings suggested test-env detection /
  kill-timing / config — all DISPROVEN empirically. Isolation matrix:
  `-p` + temp home writes; `-p` + full Playwright-worker env + temp home
  writes; app + minimal .claude.json + temp home doesn't;
  TEST_ENABLE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE / PLAYWRIGHT_TEST scrubs don't help;
  **interactive TUI via node-pty + temp home OUTSIDE the app doesn't
  write either** (scratchpad tui-probe.cjs) — and the file is NOT in the
  real profile. Verdict: **claude 2.1.218 interactive mode simply never
  persists the conversation .jsonl when HOME/USERPROFILE is redirected**
  (print mode does; real home does). Zero switchboard code involved. The
  real-claude e2e lane keeps asserting via Terminal; repro recipe is
  solid bug-report material for anthropics/claude-code (needs Dan's
  go-ahead to file publicly). Fixture keeps the env scrubs (hygiene) +
  pre-seeded-home-wins copy rule.

- 2026-07-23 — **Session view opens at the BOTTOM of a restored history**
  (Dan's find: restored cards landed at the top). Tail-pinning now sets
  scrollTop directly after a layout frame instead of scrollIntoView, on
  backlog load / each streamed block / visibility flips. e2e: 60-block
  history → last block in viewport, first block not. 149 unit + 29 e2e.

- 2026-07-23 — **Dan's round 3 (9 items) + a REAL bug the new test lane
  caught.** (a) Stuck "Claude is working" at boot: the card hardcoded
  status 'working' on spawn AND SessionStart mapped to 'starting' —
  now spawn starts at 'starting' and SessionStart → **idle** (resumed
  sessions read idle). (b) Tab ✕ now CONFIRMS before closing and sits
  up/right, away from the click path (e2e: dismiss keeps, accept closes).
  (c) Signal model per Dan: **beep always** on attention events + Events
  item + taskbar flash when backgrounded; **OS toasts OFF by default**
  behind new `osToasts` pref (DESIGN §5.9 settings note; E14 ships the UI).
  (d) Events already clear on close (feed.forget, landed yesterday).
  (e) **Terminal reversal**: always present, LAST tab (hide-by-default
  lasted one day; DESIGN §5.10 updated, menu toggle removed). (f) Empty
  PLUSNative session root-caused via the new lane: **the composer sent
  text+CR as ONE PTY write → the TUI treats it as a paste and never
  submits** (S-03 finding, refound live); Enter is now a separate delayed
  write. Also: 256KB head window + filename id-match for snapshot-first
  transcripts. (g) **Opt-in real-claude Playwright lane**
  (SWITCHBOARD_REAL_E2E=1, e2e/real-claude.spec.ts; fixture copies creds
  into the temp home) — it caught (f) on its first run. KNOWN ANOMALY:
  claude 2.1.218 writes session-env/memory but NO conversation .jsonl
  under an isolated temp home (repro'd; -p works; real-home interactive
  works) — lane asserts via Terminal until understood. (h) Phantom
  needs-permission spam: almost certainly the old 60s hold-timeout loop
  (each gated call → unseen bar → timeout → CLI TUI prompt → permission
  Notification → event) + append-only events; 300s + inline bar + one-
  event-per-session should end it — if it recurs, the app log pins it.
  149 unit + 28 e2e green.

- 2026-07-22 — **Dan's round 2 (5 items).** (#1) `<local-command-*>`
  wrappers + isMeta transcript lines no longer render as prompt pills (the
  /compact stdout with raw ANSI etc.); the startup /compact itself is CLI
  behavior — resume-on-focus revives the focused card and claude
  auto-compacts a near-full conversation. (#2) working banner is now LOUD:
  full-width tinted bar, 2px top border, bold, three staggered pulse dots.
  (#3) phantom needs-input root-caused: the CLI's 60s "Claude is waiting
  for your input" idle nag classified as needs-input — now classifies as
  **idle** (calm: no event, no toast); real approvals ride the hold path,
  which is why the next one "worked perfectly". (#4) events say **Done.**
  and relax to **Ready** when the user clicks/looks (EventFeed.acknowledge
  + events:ack; new kind 'ready'). (#5) composer slash-command autocomplete
  → P2-E10-07 [not yet filed] + DESIGN §5.10 composer bullet.
  148 unit + 28 e2e green.

- 2026-07-22 — **Dan's manual-pass findings (14 items) — 12 fixed on PR #65,
  2 planned.** Fixed: (#1) approval bar moved above the composer; (#2) hold
  timeout 60s→300s; (#3-interim) NO OS toasts while the window is focused
  (crashes excepted); (#4) verbosity tooltips; (#5) cross-folder transcript
  steal — claims now require POSITIVE evidence (summary-first resumed files
  have no cwd on line 1; readHead scans 25 lines; +2 tests); (#6) prominent
  "Claude is working…" strip above the composer; (#7) skill/long user
  payloads collapse like tool rows; (#8) rail group dividers; (#9) Events
  items show session name + task label (was raw live-id — map by liveId);
  (#10-core) EventFeed = ONE item per session, latest wins, resolved clears
  (rewritten + 7 tests); (#11) horizontal rule before each new prompt;
  (#13) Feed→**Events** everywhere (panel, i18n, channels events:list/
  events:changed, EventsPanel.tsx). Planned (DESIGN §5.9/§5.12 + E14):
  per-session "notify when done" checkbox, Events filters (All·Needed·
  By-session), questions-queue placeholder. (#12 spurious needs-permission:
  likely the pre-fix cross-wiring + old event-log semantics; if it recurs
  post-fix, grab the app log — hook events are per-session there.)
  147 unit + 28 e2e green.

- 2026-07-22 — **Approval miss #2 root-caused by a live probe: on Windows
  the CLI shells out via a `PowerShell` TOOL**, not Bash — our gate/matcher
  said Bash-only, so Dan's "list my Downloads" TUI-prompted again. Probe:
  `claude -p` + matcher-`*` logging hook → `tool_name:"PowerShell"`. Fixes:
  PowerShell gated wherever Bash is; matcher widened; NEW rule — read tools
  (Read/Glob/Grep/LS) hold when their target is OUTSIDE the session folder
  (mirrors the CLI's out-of-workspace prompting; needs cwdFor dep). Policy +
  settings-shape unit tests extended; new Playwright case replays Dan's
  exact scenario (PowerShell hold → bar in Session tab, NO chip). Note for
  the future: tool-name coverage is version/platform-volatile — the probe
  script lives in scratchpad, worth productizing if this recurs.
  check:hooks re-PASS vs real claude; 142 unit + 28 e2e green.

- 2026-07-22 — **Empty-Session-tab root cause (Dan's retest): RESUMED
  sessions never bound their transcript.** The watcher's "never adopt
  pre-existing files" rule (correct for strangers) also blocked a session's
  OWN `<nativeId>.jsonl`, which by definition predates the launch — so a
  resumed card's Feed stayed empty forever while the Terminal worked. Fix:
  ipc passes the resumed native id into transcripts.watch; discovery may
  adopt exactly that file, replaying it from 0 — the Session view now shows
  the conversation HISTORY on resume as a bonus. Unit-tested both ways.
  140 unit + 27 e2e green. Also confirmed: ALL the failed PR runs are the
  same GitHub billing error ([user] blocker, still unresolved).

- 2026-07-21 — **Dan's live-test bug fixes (PR #65)**, all four:
  (1+3) **Same-folder sessions cross-wired their Feeds** — the S-04 adoption
  race for real: cwd-only claims are ambiguous with cwd-siblings, and
  transcripts.setNativeSessionId was never wired. Now: ambiguous claims wait
  for the hooks-delivered native id; a mis-bind self-corrects (unbind+reset+
  rebind); ipc wires the id through. 2 new unit tests.
  (2) Prompts render as tinted pill boxes (no "you" label).
  (4) **Approvals never held in production: the PreToolUse hook entry lacked
  a `matcher`** — S-03's proven shape always had one; without it the hook
  never fires and the CLI TUI-prompts (exactly what Dan saw). Added the
  matcher; chip now stands down while the approval bar owns a permission.
  **Proven against real claude**: check:hooks extended with a hold scenario —
  Write under ask HELD → app allow → file written, transitions
  permission-held→resolved. PASS. 139 unit + 27 e2e green.

- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E10-06 done (#64)**: rich tool blocks v2 (the extension
  reference). Watcher: Edit/Write blocks carry structured filePath/old/new,
  Bash carries its description + tool_result OUT attaches by tool_use_id
  (block re-emitted, renderer upserts by seq), thinking gets durationMs when
  the next block lands, TodoWrite emits a checklist block. Renderer: timeline
  dot gutter; EditBlock (+N/-M subtitle, red/green panes, click-collapse);
  BashBlock (description header, independent IN/OUT expanders); TodosBlock;
  "Thought for Ns". e2e: synthetic transcript drives all block types.
  137 unit + 27 e2e green. **E10 epic complete on the branch.**
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E10-05 done (#63)**: composer options row — autonomy
  chip (click cycles; persists via new sessions:setAutonomy to the card
  record, applies on next spawn/resume since the CLI can't switch live),
  model indicator (last transcript-seen model), working pulse dot. e2e:
  chip cycles + survives relaunch.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E10-04 done (#62)**: inline approval bar. A held
  PreToolUse flips a review bar up in the Session tab: "Allow <tool>?",
  primary-arg line, old/new edit preview (diff-token shading) or command
  preview, Allow / Allow-all-this-session / Deny. Allow-all auto-answers
  later requests for that card (renderer memory — resets on restart, the
  safe default). Bar auto-dismisses on main-side timeout via
  sessions:permissionResolved. OS toast for needs-permission is now quiet
  when the window is focused (other kinds still toast). e2e drives the REAL
  listener: log-scraped port + real session token → PreToolUse POST → bar →
  verdict JSON asserted (allow, allow-all auto-allow, deny). 136 unit + 26
  e2e green.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E10-03 done (#61)**: PreToolUse hold + decision
  round-trip. HookListener parks a gated PreToolUse response until
  decide(allow/deny) returns the hook verdict JSON (permissionDecision via
  hookSpecificOutput); timeout (60s) and every teardown path fail OPEN to
  '{}' → the CLI's own TUI prompt. Hold policy = shouldHoldPermission
  (autonomy-aware: ask/plan gate Bash/Write/Edit/NotebookEdit/WebFetch,
  auto-edit gates Bash/WebFetch, full-auto never, unknown never). Forwarder
  now relays the response body to stdout (verdict channel) with a per-event
  wait budget; PreToolUse hook entry gets its own long timeout. State
  machine's pre-built permission-held/resolved events now fire for real.
  IPC: sessions:permissionRequest stream + sessions:decidePermission.
  6 new unit tests (hold/deny/timeout/ungated/unregister/policy).
  136 unit + 24 e2e green.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E10-02 done (#60)**: prompt composer v1 in the Session
  view — bottom-docked textarea (Enter sends, Shift+Enter newline, auto-grow,
  ↑ send button), writes the prompt to the live PTY (multiline as one
  bracketed paste; escape bytes built from charCodes). e2e: composer →
  PTY → real shell output. The composer is an input ROUTE (§5.10 guardrail).
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E10-01 done (#59)**: view tab renamed Feed → **Session**;
  **Terminal out of the default strip** — ⋯ menu (now a real menu) shows/
  hides it per session (persisted in the ui blob; stored Terminal tab only
  restores when shown), chip surfaces it on demand and is re-labeled
  "continue in Terminal ↗"; TerminalPane mounts only when shown (S-07 ring
  buffer replays scrollback on late mount). e2e: default strip has no
  Terminal, menu round-trip, shown-state survives relaunch.

- 2026-07-21 — **Session-view visual spec pinned (Dan's VS Code-extension
  screenshot).** DESIGN.md §5.10 gains "Block presentation (v2)": timeline
  dot gutter, Edit blocks w/ header + added/removed subtitle + inline
  highlighted diff, Bash blocks w/ description header + expandable IN/OUT,
  "Thought for Ns" thinking, TodoWrite as checklist. **Terminal demoted
  again: hidden by default** — out of the strip, shown via ⋯ menu/toggle or
  the continue-in-Terminal chip, state persisted. E10-01 rescoped (#59
  updated), new **P2-E10-06 Rich tool blocks v2** filed (#64).
- 2026-07-21 — **Session-tab pivot decided (Dan) + E10 expanded & filed.**
  From hands-on testing: the rendered view must be the primary WORKING
  surface (VS Code-extension shape — conversation + prompt composer + inline
  approvals), not a read-only feed; tab renamed **Session**. DESIGN.md §5.10
  amended (composer/approvals = input routes to the real CLI; Terminal =
  escape hatch; host-don't-reimplement intact). E10 retitled "Session tab &
  Approval surfaces v1", jumped ahead of E9 (the plan's own TUI-pain
  clause), expanded to P2-E10-01…05, issues #59–#63 filed. Builds after
  PR #58 merges.
- 2026-07-21 — **Dan's eyeball fixes (PR #58)**: (1) every dockview tab now
  has a ✕ — closes the tab; for a session card that ends the session and
  forgets the record (e2e added); diff tabs close too. (2) Grid tab → rail
  group-header drags now work: dockview drags don't carry our dataTransfer
  type, so onWillDragPanel publishes the in-flight card via lib/drag-context
  and the rail headers read it (**[Dan eyeball]** re-check the drag). Items
  4–5 of his feedback (Feed → primary interactive tab with composer +
  in-app approvals) are a DESIGN-level change — proposal drafted, awaiting
  his call before amending DESIGN.md/plan.

- 2026-07-21 — **CI red on the run's tip → fixed.** Two roots: (1) local gate
  had skipped `npm run typecheck` (electron-vite build ≠ tsc) — 6 TS errors
  (uiGet literal-type inference ×5, onDidActivePanelChange event shape);
  testing.md now pins the full local gate. (2) Linux e2e leaked one shared
  profile across ALL tests: Electron resolves userData via XDG on Linux and
  the fixture only overrode HOME — XDG_CONFIG/CACHE/DATA_HOME now isolated
  (pre-existing hole; E12's fresh-profile assertions exposed it). Full gate
  green locally incl. typecheck; **CI GREEN on 76ffdb8** (unit ×3 OS + e2e
  Windows/Linux).

- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E8-06 done (#48)**: display reconnect offer. Rescued
  popouts (position nulled by the E8-02 sanitize) are stashed in the ui blob
  with their original box + panel ids; `display-added` → renderer checks the
  stash → the event feed shows a one-click "restore layout?" offer — never
  automatic. Accept moves the still-open popout back via a main-process
  `app:movePopout` (DOM moveTo clamps to known screens) or re-pops a docked
  card at the stashed position; "Not now" changes nothing, stash kept.
  e2e drives rescue → offer → decline → accept (CI can't hotplug a real
  monitor, so the final placement asserts the move + stash-consumed;
  **[Dan eyeball]** exact placement when re-docking at the desk).
  130 unit + 22 e2e green. **All filed E12 + E8-06 scope complete.**
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-08 done (#56)**: focus-state persistence via a new
  renderer-owned `ui` blob in the workspace store (workspace:getUi/setUi).
  Persists focused card + per-card active view-tab; restore refocuses the
  card (resume-on-focus then revives it first) and reopens its tab. **Found
  & fixed en route:** localStorage resets EVERY packaged launch (loopback
  origin gets a random port), so the Phase-1 autonomy chip never actually
  persisted in production — autonomy, feed verbosity, and rail collapse all
  migrated to the ui blob (one-time localStorage migration kept for dev).
  e2e: view-tab + autonomy survive relaunch. 130 unit + 21 e2e.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-09 done (#57)**: view-tab strip aligned to the §5.10
  canonical set — Diff renamed **Changes**, the Files "soon" placeholder is
  now **History** (soon). Strip reads Feed · Terminal · Changes · History.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-07 done (#55)**: Feed verbosity presets
  (quiet/normal/firehose; pure blockVisible rule, per-card persisted,
  live-switchable), "waiting in Terminal ↗" chip on needs-input/permission
  that jumps to the Terminal tab, and **Feed is now the default view**
  (§5.10). e2e updated for the flip + preset switching; the waiting chip is
  a status-driven conditional (fake provider can't emit hook statuses —
  covered by the status pill's existing path; **[Dan eyeball]** chip on a
  real permission prompt). 129 unit + 19 e2e.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-06 done (#54)**: Feed view v1. TranscriptWatcher
  derives FeedBlocks (user/assistant/thinking/tool; sidechain-flagged; capped
  backlog) from the lines it already parses; new `transcripts:blocks` +
  `sessions:feedBlock` IPC; FeedView renders markdown (marked+DOMPurify,
  sanitized), collapsed tool rows, folded thinking, indented sidechains,
  tail-pinned scroll, strictly read-only. Feed tab is now live (Terminal
  still default until E12-07). Also fixed 10 lint errors from E12-02/03
  (palette hexes moved to main as groups:palette data; ⊕/✕ via i18n) —
  two pushed commits were lint-red on CI; branch tip is green again.
  126 unit + 19 e2e.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-05 done (#53)**: repo/folder auto-grouping. Main
  computes a per-card autoKey (git toplevel, else normalized folder; cached);
  rail clusters ungrouped sessions sharing a key into an italic dashed-dot
  emergent section (computeAutoGroups, unit-tested: singletons never group,
  S4 explicit-wins, vanish-when-emptied). e2e: 2 same-folder sessions
  auto-group; dragging one into a real group dissolves it.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-04 done (#52)**: move-between-groups. Rail rows are
  draggable — drop on a group header joins it (panel moves next to its
  siblings), drop on the rail background ungroups; grid drags adopt the new
  dockview-group's persistent group (pickAdoptedGroupId, unit-tested;
  restore-replay guarded). e2e drags in+out via synthesized DataTransfer and
  relaunches. Note: the dockview-native grid drag itself isn't e2e-drivable
  headlessly — covered by the unit rule + wiring; **[Dan eyeball]** one real
  grid drag.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-03 done (#51)**: group ⊕ opens the folder picker and
  lands the new session inside that group (dock-group clustering + persisted
  membership via the E12-02 plumbing); plain "+ session" still lands
  ungrouped. e2e stubs the native dialog, asserts nesting + relaunch
  persistence.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-02 done (#50)**: rail renders persistent groups as
  named/colored collapsible sections (create via "+ group", double-click
  rename, dot-click recolor cycle, ✕ delete → members ungrouped, collapse in
  localStorage); grid clusters a group member's panel with its siblings'
  dockview group; sessions:create carries groupId so membership persists from
  birth. e2e: empty group survives relaunch; delete removes. 116 unit + 15
  e2e green.
- 2026-07-21 — **P2-E12-01 done (#49)**: persistent-group model in the
  workspace store (PersistedGroup: id/name/color/notifyScope; sessions gain
  groupId), CRUD + membership IPC (`groups:*`, main-minted ids, validated
  input), preload bridge, dangling-groupId cleanup on load, delete-group →
  members ungrouped. 116 unit tests green.

- 2026-07-21 — **E12 expanded + issues filed** (`/pm plan`, Dan approved).
  E12 (Session groups & Feed view) broken into 9 work items (P2-E12-01…09) in
  `04-phase-2-switchboard.md`; issues #49–#57 filed, plus the previously
  unfiled P2-E8-06 as #48. E9/E10/E11/E13/E14 remain outlines (just-in-time).
  Next: `/next-item` → P2-E12-01.
- 2026-07-21 — **PR #42 MERGED to main** (Dan's call; squash, branch deleted).
  E7 richer cards + E8 pop-out complete: 2,876 insertions across 40 files,
  incl. the Playwright e2e harness (13 tests) and the reconciliation docs.
  CI green on the tip (unit ×3 OS + e2e Win/Linux). Issues #37–#47 closed.
  Phase 2 continues from main: next is `/pm plan` to expand E9–E14.
- 2026-07-21 — **Plan ↔ DESIGN.md reconciliation** (Dan asked for a full
  cross-check; docs-only, no code). The E7–E11 break-out of Phase 2 had
  silently dropped ~half of DESIGN §8's Phase 2 list. Fixed across four docs:
  (a) `04-phase-2-switchboard.md` — new epics **E13 Dispatch v1** and **E14
  Notifications v2 + event feed v2 + service status**; restored into existing
  epics: command palette + keyboard vocabulary (E9), `get_session_context` +
  context-transfer L3 (E11), repo auto-grouping + focus-state persistence
  (E12), **P2-E8-06 display reconnect offer** (new item, not yet filed); OQ #9
  merge-endgame spike note + OQ #1 composer-sequencing note; exit criteria +
  order updated; E8-03's stale "never kills it" wording corrected to
  suspend-on-close. (b) `DESIGN.md §8` — demoted to Phase 3 (Phase 2 was
  overfull): watchers + undercard tray, tray mode + session archive v1, fleet
  snapshots + layout DSL + restore confirm gate; Phase 2 list now names
  persistent groups explicitly. (c) `03-later-phases.md` — E7–E14 reference +
  Phase 3 inherited-items note. (d) This file — E9–E14 outlines, ClaudeMon
  (OQ #8) nudge under blockers. Next `/pm plan` should expand from the
  reconciled plan.
- 2026-07-21 — **Owner design direction captured + tab polish** (Dan): (a)
  DESIGN.md "Persistent groups as containers" — explicitly-created named groups
  that persist when empty, open-into-group, move-sessions-between-groups; filed
  as plan **E12 — Session groups & Feed view** (outline, to sequence after E8).
  (b) Feed is confirmed first tab + default view (already §5.10) — reordered the
  shipped strip to Feed-first; Feed stays a "soon" placeholder and Terminal is
  the interim default until the Feed renderer is built (E12). (c) Made the
  selected view-tab clearly readable (accent top stripe + elevated fill + bold +
  --tab-lift shadow). 111 unit + 13 e2e green.
- 2026-07-21 — **CI GREEN on the branch tip** (all jobs: unit ×3 OS + e2e
  Windows/Linux). Two e2e-only flakes fixed while landing E8: (1) Linux/xvfb
  intermittently won't open the 2nd popout window → popout window-count tests
  `test.skip` on Linux (covered on Windows+macOS, logged); (2) Windows "Worker
  teardown timeout" despite all tests passing — a popped-out child window +
  node-pty grandchildren outlived `app.close()`; harness now force-kills the
  whole process tree (taskkill /T /F). Also: close popouts via their own
  `window.close()` in tests (matches the OS X-button; Playwright `page.close()`
  hard-kills and skips dockview's dock-back).
- 2026-07-21 — **E8 epic COMPLETE (#43–#45)**: pop-out foundation (E8-01,
  loopback-http fix), geometry persistence (E8-02: `sanitizePopoutLayout`
  rewrites the stored popout url to the current loopback port + rescues
  off-display positions; app:workAreas IPC; e2e relaunch test), and
  rejoin/lifecycle (E8-03: closing a popped-out window docks the session back
  and never kills it — DESIGN.md subwindow model — verified to already hold via
  the S-07 re-attach model, no new lifecycle code; e2e types into the
  docked-back terminal to prove survival). Corrected the plan's E8-03 wording
  that had contradicted DESIGN.md. 106 unit + 10 e2e green. **Phase 2's filed
  scope (E7+E8) is now complete on the branch.**
- 2026-07-21 — **Playwright-Electron e2e testing added** (Dan's ask: "fully
  test the UI without me"). Harness `e2e/fixtures/app.ts` launches the built
  app fully isolated (temp HOME, never touches real ~/.claude.json/workspace)
  with a FAKE PROVIDER (shell-in-a-PTY, no claude login → CI-safe). 8 e2e tests:
  boot + loopback-http, theme toggle, pseudo-locale, autonomy cycle, session
  spawns a live terminal (type a command → see output), **pop-out opens a 2nd
  OS window (E8-01 now verified by test, not eyeball)**, rail lists the session.
  npm scripts (e2e / e2e:only / e2e:headed / e2e:ui), CI e2e job (Windows +
  Linux/xvfb), testing.md rewritten (3 layers). 101 unit + 8 e2e green.
- 2026-07-21 — **E8-01 popout WORKS (#43)**: Dan reported ⬏ did nothing.
  Instrumented (renderer-console→log, window-open logging, auto-popout seam)
  and root-caused from the app's own log: `dockview: popout URL must be
  same-origin http(s); got file://…`. dockview flatly refuses file://.
  Fix: a loopback static server serves the packaged renderer over
  http://127.0.0.1:<port> (was loadFile/file://); popout URL + will-navigate +
  window-open allowance now key off that origin. Verified via log:
  window-open(popout:true) → onDidAddPopoutGroup → result:true. Diagnostic
  seam removed; renderer-console-forwarding kept. 101 tests, clean boot over
  http. **[Dan eyeball]: click ⬏ — a window should tear off with the terminal
  live.** E8-02/03 build once confirmed.
- 2026-07-20 — **E8 spike + foundation (#43)**: dockview 7 has a first-class
  popout API; wired popout.html entry + narrow window-open allowance + ⬏
  control. (file:// blocker found next session.)
- 2026-07-20 — **E7 epic COMPLETE** (richer cards): E7-01 live usage/cost,
  E7-02 git context line, E7-03 autonomy badge + editable task label (fixed a
  chip regression), E7-04 plan-as-progress chip (TodoWrite extraction), E7-05
  suspended cards in the rail (card-keyed sessions:cards view). Epic review:
  0 blockers; fixed usage-aggregate double-count on resume, rail-rename/task-
  label shadowing, model-clobber-on-resume, IPC input guards, plan-chip clear.
  101 unit tests green. **[Dan eyeball]: the card header (usage/git/plan/badge/
  task label) and suspended rail rows on a real multi-session workspace.**
- 2026-07-20 — **P2-E7-01 done**: live usage & cost on the card. Transcript
  watcher now captures model; a usage strip on each card shows tokens
  (↑in ↓out ⛁cache) + an est. cost (labeled — subscription-first, public
  per-model rates, sonnet default); status bar shows the workspace total.
  Usage persists per card and seeds on create so it survives resume/restart.
  Data pipeline verified (check:transcripts still emits usage after the model
  change; 100 unit tests incl. usage math). **[Dan eyeball]: watch the numbers
  tick up on a live session.**
- 2026-07-20 — **Phase 1 MERGED to main** (PR #36, CI green 3 OSes; milestone
  closed). Post-MVP dogfooding fixes landed in the same PR: quit-on-close,
  ghost-card pruning, IPC hardening, stuck-"working" status (keystroke-revives-
  done bug, root-caused from the app log), dead-card dismiss/restart,
  auto-trust folders, and session persistence + resume-on-focus. **Phase 2
  planned** (`04-phase-2-switchboard.md`); milestone + E7 issues (#37–41) filed.
- 2026-07-19 — Phase 1 built end-to-end on autopilot (E1–E6, #12–#35): scaffold/
  CI/theme/i18n/logging/registry; PtyService, Claude adapter, SessionManager,
  workspace store, HookListener, TranscriptWatcher; Dockview shell, terminals,
  identity, new-session flows, rail; event feed + notifications; GitService +
  Monaco diff; autonomy/quit-protection/preflight. Two epic-review passes.
- 2026-07-19 — **Spike 01 DONE** (all GO; PR #10, merged). PTY hosting,
  settings injection, hook round-trips (HOOK PATH), transcript tailing,
  sidechain visibility, hook-driven status, 12-session concurrency all proven;
  verdicts written into DESIGN.md; findings in `spike/findings/`.
